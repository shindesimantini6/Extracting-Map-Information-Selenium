# Extracting-Map-Information-Selenium

This is an attempt at using Selenium to automatically click on all points on the CSS map and extract the existing information on those points. The solution is not yet complete but it gives hope in the direction of finding a way to automatically extract information instead of manually clicking at each point. 

In the video it can be seen that using Selenium the log in details are inputted and using a offset of 1 on x-axis every point is clicked and at some point the information box becomes empty, which indicates the working of the code.
